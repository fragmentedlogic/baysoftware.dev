    <h2 id="why">Why we exist</h2>
    <p>We build useful, reliable software that respects people, their time, and our share reality. We keep things
      simple, clean, and
      improve continuously.</p>
  </section>

  <section aria-labelledby="how">
    <h2 id="how">How we work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>People first.</strong> Health and family come before work while we meet commitments.</li>
      <li><strong>Delivery over theater.</strong> Working software on time. Quality over quantity.</li>
      <li><strong>Remote and async.</strong> Work when you perform best.</li>
      <li><strong>AI as leverage.</strong> Offload repetitive work to AI. Keep humans in the loop.</li>
      <li><strong>Evidence, not opinions.</strong> Decisions use data, benchmarks, and user feedback.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section aria-labelledby="values">
    <h2 id="values">What we value</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We Respect across differences; we are a safe space.</li>
      <li>We Do no harm. Build safe, lawful, responsible products.</li>
      <li>We Follow Standards and re-usability first; we don’t reinvent wheels—it's not our business.</li>
      <li>We Deliver Small, modular, observable systems.</li>
      <li>We Are Open by default; we support the oss community</li>
      <li>We Learn from mistakes, correct, improve, harden, deliver, and move forward.</li>
      <li>We Profit with fairness: share credit, give credit where credit is due.</li>
    </ul>

  <section aria-labelledby="pragmatic">
    <h2 id="pragmatic">Pragmatic practices we follow</h2>
    <p>We align our day-to-day engineering with the spirit of <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>. The highlights below
      are paraphrased and adapted to our context.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Own the craft.</strong> Be deliberate. Offer options, not excuses. Fix issues when you see them.</li>
      <li><strong>DRY and orthogonal.</strong> Keep a single source of truth. Favor small, independent components that
        don’t leak effects.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Design for change.</strong> Decisions are provisional. Prefer configuration to hard integration. Put
        specifics in metadata.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Probe before you commit.</strong> Use tracer bullets and prototypes to learn. Estimate to avoid
        surprises and adjust as we build.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Plain tools, powerful habits.</strong> Prefer plain text. Master a shell and one excellent editor. Use
        source control everywhere.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Concurrency and services.</strong> Design for parallel work, clear interfaces, and separation of
        concerns.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Debug with discipline.</strong> Prove assumptions. Use assertions. Treat exceptions as exceptional.
        Fail fast when safer.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Test like we mean it.</strong> Design for testability. Automate unit, integration, and end‑to‑end
        tests. Never find the same bug twice.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Write to be read.</strong> Build documentation into the work. Maintain a project glossary. Communicate
        clearly.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Teams and tools.</strong> Organize around functionality. Automate manual steps. Choose tools on merit.
      </li>
    </ul>
